#  IoT case study with ESP32 and ESP82
Being implemented with MCUs (Microcontrollers), it also allows them to directly serial communicate with physical instruments such as temperature sensors and actuators. In this case study, we will be using a variable resistor to simulate the use of getting data from other sensors that provides data logging. We can measure our analog voltage with an Arduino and PIC microcontroller using a potentiometer.
To prove the ability of IoT communicating with microcontrollers, we will be using a ESP32 developments and ESP-01 as IoT modules to communicate with an Arduino board and a PIC18f4550 microcontroller, respectively.
